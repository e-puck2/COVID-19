# COVID-19
We implemented some basic concepts of local infection transmission and proximity tracing exploiting Bluetooth 4 on our robot e-puck2. The goal is to provide an open source framework and to visualize the positive effect of proximity tracing APP within a pandemic such as COVID-19. Such a simulation and demonstration can be extended by the community and we do not pretend that this initial effort is scientifically valid. However already with the initial parameters it becomes clear that self-quarantine triggered by a proximity tracing APP is beneficial.
